        <p>Hi! My name is Callie Boyette I have been working with Photography now for about 6 years and love it.  I am attending Wake Tech Community College right now to get my degree in Graphic Design.  
            I love capturing pictures of my family and friends, I also enjoy taking pictures of babies and younger children.  Although one of my favorite things to do is go out on my own and take beautiful pictures of nature such as animals, flowers, and landscapes.  
            An example is this image I took of a squirrel laying on a treebrach I spotted at Pullen Park in Raleigh Nc.  I hope one day I can find a job so that I can use my photography skills with my Graphic Design experiences.

            <p>I decided to come to Wake Tech after my freshman year at Meredith College,
                 because I struggled in the other classes that were required at Meredith. 
                 Wake Tech mainly just focuses on the degree you are trying to accomplish. 
                  I have enjoyed being at Wake Tech the professors are great and if you are struggling in any class there is many different options to get the help you need.</p>
